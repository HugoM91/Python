Some of my personal python projects that allowed me learn how to code. 
All of this were made for learning purposes and for fun.

They include :

Call of Duty - Warzone statistics bot, that connects with a telegram group and makes a personalized ranking between the group participants.

Discord Notifications bot that scans binance live data and sends a message to discord websockets. There are a lot of warnings the bot sends.

Another notifications bot but for telegram (and a little bit more organized).

A bot that can be used in a restaurant at the end of the day that analyses the days "numbers", stores it and sends the day's end report.

Day trading crypto bot that receives data from binace, stores that data, uses the data in a machine learning library and sends a Buy or Sell signal after.
This was my first bot, it was very challenging and a good ride.
